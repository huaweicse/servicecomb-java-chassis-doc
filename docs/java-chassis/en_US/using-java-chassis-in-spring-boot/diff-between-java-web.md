Both development methods will enable the full functionality of the java chassis. The JAVA application mode runs on a separate HTTP server (based on vert.x), which has great advantages in performance. The web development method runs on Tomcat or other built-in web servers and receives requests as a servlet. Therefore, during the development process, you can use some functions provided by the web container, such as providing page services and using Filter. When the application only needs to provide REST services, and performance requirements are high, it is recommended to use a JAVA application mode.
